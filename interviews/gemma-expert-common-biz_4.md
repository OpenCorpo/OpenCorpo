## Problem: Managing customer churn

**Challenge:** High customer churn rates are significantly impacting our revenue and brand image. We need to identify and address the root causes of churn before it becomes unmanageable.

**Solution:** Implement a machine learning-based churn prediction model that analyzes customer behavior, demographics, and purchase history. 

This model could:

* Identify early warning signs of churn risk based on specific patterns.
* Predict which customers are most likely to churn.
* Recommend proactive measures to retain customers, such as targeted retention campaigns.
* Analyze the impact of different retention strategies on churn rates.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced churn rate:** By preventing customer losses, we can improve our profitability and maintain strong customer relationships.
* **Improved customer lifetime value:** Churn reduction leads to increased revenue from existing customers, boosting their lifetime value.
* **Enhanced brand reputation:** By demonstrating a commitment to customer retention, we can build trust and improve brand loyalty.

**Evaluation:**

* **Accuracy:** How well does the model perform in predicting churn risk?
* **Scalability:** Can the model be implemented with sufficient data and resources?
* **Ethical considerations:** What are the potential biases and ethical concerns associated with the model?
* **Return on investment (ROI):** What is the estimated cost of implementing this solution and its potential impact on ROI?
