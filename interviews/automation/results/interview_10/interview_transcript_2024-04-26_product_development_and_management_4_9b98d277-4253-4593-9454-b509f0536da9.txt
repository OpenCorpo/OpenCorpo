**Challenge:** A large e-commerce company wants to integrate their sales data with customer behavior data from various social media platforms. They aim to analyze this combined data to improve marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. However, they struggle to handle the sheer volume of data and ensure data freshness.

Please provide your solution for integrating sales data with social media behavioral data while addressing data volume, freshness, and governance concerns.

User: **Problem to Evaluate:**

**Challenge:**

- Handling the volume and velocity of data from multiple social media platforms.
- Ensuring data freshness and consistency across various data sources.
- Maintaining data governance and compliance while integrating with multiple sources.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Data ingestion and processing pipelines
- Data quality monitoring and cleansing
- Data lineage tracking for traceability
- Data security and access control measures
- Governance and compliance documentation

Assistant: Another exciting challenge!

Here's my solution:

**Data Ingestion and Processing Pipelines:**

1. Design a scalable data pipeline using Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis to handle the high-volume and high-velocity social media data from multiple platforms.
2. Implement data processing using Apache Spark, Hadoop, or AWS Glue to transform and aggregate data from various sources.

**Data Quality Monitoring and Cleansing:**

1. Develop a data quality monitoring framework using tools like Talend, Informatica PowerCenter, or AWS Glue to detect and alert on data inconsistencies and anomalies.
2. Implement data cleansing techniques such as data validation, normalization, and standardization to ensure consistent data across sources.

**Data Lineage Tracking for Traceability:**

1. Use metadata management tools like Apache Atlas, Google Cloud Data Catalog, or AWS Glue to track the origin, transformation, and flow of data throughout the pipeline.
2. Implement data lineage tracking using techniques such as data versioning, timestamping, and auditing to ensure transparency and accountability.

**Data Security and Access Control Measures:**

1. Ensure data encryption in transit using SSL/TLS and at rest using AES-256 or similar algorithms.
2. Implement access controls using role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), or row-level security (RLS) to restrict data access based on user roles, permissions, and privileges.

**Governance and Compliance Documentation:**

1. Develop a comprehensive data governance framework that outlines policies, procedures, and guidelines for data management, quality, security, and compliance.
2. Create documentation on data lineage, processing pipelines, and data quality monitoring to ensure transparency and accountability.

Here's a high-level architecture diagram illustrating the solution:
