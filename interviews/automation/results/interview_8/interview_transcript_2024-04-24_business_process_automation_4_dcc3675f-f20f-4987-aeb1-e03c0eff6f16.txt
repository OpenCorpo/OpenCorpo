Assistant: Thank you for your enthusiasm!

Let's get started.

**Business Process Overview**

Our company, OpenCorpo, is a leading provider of digital solutions for corporate services. We offer a suite of products that enable businesses to streamline their operations, improve customer engagement, and drive growth.

The process I'd like to automate is our "Onboarding New Clients" workflow. This involves several manual steps, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. The goal is to reduce the onboarding time from 5 days to under 1 day while maintaining the same level of quality and security.

**Current Challenges**

1. **Manual Data Entry**: Our current process requires multiple teams to manually enter client information into different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies.
2. **Delays in Verification**: The verification process for new clients is slow due to manual checks and approvals from various teams, causing delays in onboarding.
3. **Limited Visibility**: We lack real-time visibility into the onboarding process, making it challenging to track progress and identify bottlenecks.

**Automation Requirements**

We need a solution that can:

1. Automate data entry by integrating with our CRM system.
2. Streamline verification processes through automated checks and approvals.
3. Provide real-time tracking and monitoring of the onboarding process.
4. Ensure secure data handling and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Now it's your turn! What solutions do you propose for automating our Onboarding New Clients workflow?
