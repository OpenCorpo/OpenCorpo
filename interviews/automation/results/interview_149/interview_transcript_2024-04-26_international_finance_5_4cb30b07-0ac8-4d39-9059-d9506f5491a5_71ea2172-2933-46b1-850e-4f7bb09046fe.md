**Assistant**: Excellent! To help you address the weaknesses and suggestions, I'd like to provide some additional context and information.

**Regulatory Collaboration:**

* The investment bank is subject to regulations from multiple jurisdictions, including the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and country-specific regulations.

**Data Security:**

* The investment bank handles sensitive customer data, including personal identifiable information (PII), financial information, and other confidential details.
* You will need to design a robust security framework that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data. This may include measures such as:
	+ Encryption at rest and in transit
	+ Access controls and role-based permissions
	+ Regular backups and disaster recovery planning
	+ Incident response and breach notification procedures

**Pilot Implementation:**

* The investment bank is willing to consider a pilot implementation, but it must be carefully planned and executed to minimize risks and ensure success.
* You will need to develop a detailed plan for the pilot, including:
	+ Defining specific objectives and metrics for evaluation
	+ Identifying key stakeholders and their roles in the pilot
