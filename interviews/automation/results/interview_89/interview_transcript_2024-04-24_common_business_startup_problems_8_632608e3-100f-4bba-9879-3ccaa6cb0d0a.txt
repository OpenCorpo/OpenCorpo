This would reduce the likelihood of order fulfillment issues and improve customer satisfaction.
3. **Marketing Analytics and Reporting**: By integrating with their marketing automation tools, the platform would provide actionable insights on customer behavior, campaign performance, and ROI. "Gourmet Bites" could use this data to refine their marketing strategies and allocate resources more effectively.
