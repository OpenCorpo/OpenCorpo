Provide strategic direction and oversight\n2. Ensure accountability and transparency\n3. Promote ethical conduct throughout the organization\n\nFrameworks and guidelines for strengthening corporate governance practices include:\n\n1. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) in the US\n2. The UK's Corporate Governance Code\n3. The International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN)'s Principles of Corporate Governance\n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of current corporate governance structures involves:\n\n1. Assessing board composition and diversity\n2. Reviewing reporting and disclosure practices\n3. Evaluating shareholder engagement and activism\n\n**Step 4: Problem Identification**\n\nA pressing ethical or governance challenge facing businesses today is the increasing pressure to prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability, leading to environmental degradation, social injustice, and reputational damage.\n\nSpecific problem statement:\n\n\"How can businesses balance their financial goals with their responsibility to address climate change and promote social justice, while maintaining transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes?\"\n\nYour expertise in business ethics and corporate governance would be valuable in developing a comprehensive solution to this problem.",
