They have three production lines, each with different capacity constraints:\n\n1. **Line 1**: Can produce up to 10,000 units per day\n2. **Line 2**: Can produce up to 8,000 units per day\n3. **Line 3**: Can produce up to 12,000 units per day\n\nThe manufacturer receives daily production orders from their customers, which can vary greatly in terms of quantity and product mix.

Consider factors such as:\n\n* How can you allocate resources to meet the demand of the current day's order, while also minimizing waste?\n* What impact will tomorrow's order have on today's production plan?\n\n**Step 3:** Create a simulation scenario in OpenCorpo that simulates different production scenarios, taking into account potential disruptions or changes in demand. For example:\n\n* Simulate a 10% increase in production volume due to increased demand\n* Simulate a 20% decrease in production volume due to a supply chain disruption\n\n**Step 4:** Use OpenCorpo's decision support tools to analyze the results of your simulations and provide recommendations for improving resource allocation.\n\nPlease propose a solution that addresses these steps using OpenCorpo.
