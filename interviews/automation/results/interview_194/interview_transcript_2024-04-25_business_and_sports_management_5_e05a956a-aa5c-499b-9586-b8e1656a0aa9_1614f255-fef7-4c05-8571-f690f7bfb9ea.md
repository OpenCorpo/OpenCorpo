	+ Fan satisfaction surveys
* To incentivize optimal performance while maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle for players, I would suggest implementing a combination of the following:
	+ Performance-based bonuses tied to specific KPIs
	+ Wellness-focused incentives, such as extra days off or access to on-site fitness facilities
	+ Team-building activities that promote bonding and camaraderie
	+ Education and training programs focused on injury prevention, sports nutrition, and mental wellness

Here's a potential solution:
