We've been struggling to acquire new customers in the past quarter, despite our sales team's best efforts. Our CRM data suggests that our sales outreach strategies are not resonating with potential clients.\n\nSpecifically, we're facing the following technological challenges:\n\n1. **Data Integration**: Our current CRM system is not seamlessly integrated with other marketing and sales tools (e.g., email marketing software, social media management platforms). This makes it difficult for us to track customer interactions across multiple channels.\n2. **Lead Qualification**: We need a more efficient way to qualify leads and identify potential customers who are most likely to convert into paying clients.\n3. **Personalization**: Our sales outreach efforts often feel generic or impersonal, which can lead to low response rates.\n\nCan you propose some technological solutions to address these challenges? Please provide specific suggestions for data integration, lead qualification, and personalization.",
