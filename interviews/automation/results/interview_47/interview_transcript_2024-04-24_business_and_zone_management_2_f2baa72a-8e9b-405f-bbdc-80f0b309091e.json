This can be achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. **Business-IT Alignment**: Establish clear communication channels between business leaders and IT teams to ensure alignment of IT strategies with business objectives.\n2. **Zone-based Governance**: Implement a zone-based governance structure, where each zone has its own governance board, consisting of business stakeholders, IT representatives, and compliance experts. This will enable zone-level decision-making, resource allocation, and issue resolution.\n3. **Automated Compliance Monitoring**: Utilize automation tools to monitor and report on compliance with industry regulations, reducing the risk of non-compliance and improving overall efficiency.\n4. **Risk-based Prioritization**: Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential security threats and prioritize mitigation efforts accordingly.\n5. **Continuous Training and Education**: Provide regular training sessions for IT staff and business stakeholders on IT governance, compliance, and security best practices.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n* Improved alignment between business and IT goals\n* Enhanced transparency and accountability at the zone level\n* Reduced risk of non-compliance and improved regulatory reporting\n* Increased operational efficiency through automation and prioritization\n* Improved employee skills and knowledge in IT governance and compliance\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a good starting point, or would you like me to revise anything?",
