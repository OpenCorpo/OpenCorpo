3. Allocate stock to different warehouses (if multi-warehouse setup).
4. Monitor and report on inventory levels.

Inefficiencies:
* Manual update of stock levels causes errors.
* Lack of real-time visibility into inventory across locations.

Customer Support:

1. Customers contact support team via phone, email, or chat.
2. Support agents resolve issues or escalate to specialists.
3. Agents update customer records in CRM system.

Inefficiencies:
* Long wait times for customers due to high volume of calls.
* Inconsistent resolution of issues.

**E-Commerce:**

Product Discovery:

1. Customers browse product categories and search filters.
2. Recommended products displayed based on purchase history.
3. Products with similar characteristics displayed.

Inefficiencies:
* Limited personalization options.
* Outdated product recommendations.

Purchase:

1. Customers add items to cart.
2. Review order summary and checkout process.
3. Complete payment via various methods (credit cards, etc.).

Inefficiencies:
* High cart abandonment rate due to lengthy checkout process.
* Lack of multiple shipping option visibility.

Returns:

1. Customers initiate return through website or store.
2. Inspect returned items for damage or restocking issues.
3. Process refunds and exchange requests.

Inefficiencies:
* Inefficient returns processing leading to delayed refunds.
* Limited options for customers to initiate returns (phone, email only).

**Step 2: Process Optimization**

Bottlenecks:

* Manual update of order status
* Limited visibility into inventory levels
* Inconsistent resolution of customer issues
* Limited personalization options
* High cart abandonment rate due to lengthy checkout process

Automation Opportunities:
* Automate order status updates using workflow management software.
* Implement real-time inventory tracking and visibility across locations.

**Step 3: Stakeholder Input**

Key stakeholders:

* Operations team (order fulfillment, inventory management)
* Customer support team
* Marketing team (product discovery)
* IT department

Priorities:

1. Improve customer experience through reduced wait times and efficient issue resolution.
2. Increase operational efficiency through automation and streamlined processes.

**Step 4: Problem Statement Generation**

Problem Statement:
How can we reduce the average order processing time by 30% and decrease customer support resolution times by 25%, while maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, within the next 6 months?

Evaluation Criteria:

1. Efficiency improvement (reduced processing time)
2. Customer experience enhancement (improved resolution times, satisfaction)
3. Cost reduction (streamlined processes, automation)
4. Scalability and resilience (real-time inventory tracking, automated updates)
