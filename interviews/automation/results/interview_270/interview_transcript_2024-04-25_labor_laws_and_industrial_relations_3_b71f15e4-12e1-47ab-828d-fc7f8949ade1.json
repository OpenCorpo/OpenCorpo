I particularly like the emphasis on establishing a clear policy framework, implementing access management systems, and conducting regular compliance audits.\n\nFor Step 3, I'd like to evaluate your responses with a more specific problem:\n\n**Problem:** A global financial institution is facing a data breach that has exposed sensitive customer information. The incident response team has been activated, but the organization needs to determine the extent of the breach, notify affected customers, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nYour task is to provide a detailed plan for containing the breach, conducting an investigation, and implementing measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Please consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Containment: How would you isolate the breached systems and networks to prevent further data exfiltration?\n2. Investigation: What steps would you take to determine the cause of the breach, identify affected customers, and assess the potential impact on the institution's reputation?\n3. Notification: How would you inform affected customers and regulatory bodies about the breach, and what information would you provide in these notifications?\n4. Prevention: What measures would you implement to prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future, including changes to policies, procedures, and technical controls?\n\nPlease provide your detailed plan for containing, investigating, notifying, and preventing this data breach incident.",
