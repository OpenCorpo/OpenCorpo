The proposed solution for business and program management appears comprehensive and effective. It covers essential features for project management, business intelligence, and communication and collaboration. The benefits listed, such as improved project efficiency, enhanced communication, and increased transparency, are substantial.

However, implementing these solutions within a large organization with diverse departments poses significant challenges. To effectively implement the solution, I would recommend the following steps:

**Problem:** "Optimizing Sponsorship ROI in Professional Sports Leagues"

As the Chief Revenue Officer of a professional sports league, you've noticed a decline in sponsorship revenue over the past few seasons. The current sponsorship portfolio consists of traditional partnerships with local and national brands, but the league wants to revitalize its sponsorship strategy to attract more innovative and impactful partners.

The league's stakeholders are concerned about:
