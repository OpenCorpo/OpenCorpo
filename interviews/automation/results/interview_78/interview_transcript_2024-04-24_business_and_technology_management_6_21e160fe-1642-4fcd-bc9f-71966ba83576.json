I'll evaluate your answer and provide feedback.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. You've outlined a clear structure with distinct phases, making it easy to follow your thought process.\n2. Your proposal includes the use of artificial intelligence and automation, which is an innovative approach to streamline compliance processes.\n3. You've identified potential challenges and opportunities associated with implementation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The assessment phase could be more detailed, considering specific regulatory changes, industry trends, and stakeholder concerns.\n2. The proposal framework could benefit from more concrete examples of automated solutions for compliance.\n3. The problem statement may not clearly define the desired future state of accounting standards and regulations.\n\n**Feedback and Problem Identification:**\n\nThe current state of accounting standards and regulations is characterized by complexity, inconsistency, and a lack of automation. This leads to increased costs, inefficiencies, and potential errors. The desired future state should be one where accounting standards are clear, consistent, and easily enforced through automated processes.\n\n**Next Step:**\nGiven the time remaining (25 minutes), I'll pose a new problem:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nDesign a data analytics platform for small to medium-sized businesses to monitor and manage their financial performance, compliance, and risk management in real-time.
