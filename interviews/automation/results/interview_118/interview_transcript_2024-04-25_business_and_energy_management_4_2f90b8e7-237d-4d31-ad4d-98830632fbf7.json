You've clearly identified the challenges that businesses face in energy management, which sets a strong foundation for your proposal.\n2. Your cloud-based platform idea is a good starting point, as it allows for real-time monitoring and analytics, which can lead to more informed decision-making.\n3. The AI-driven resource optimization aspect is also a valuable addition, as it can help businesses optimize their energy usage and reduce waste.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. While you've listed some benefits of your solution, it would be helpful to provide more concrete numbers or statistics to demonstrate the impact it could have on a business.\n2. Your proposal lacks specificity regarding how your platform and AI-driven optimization will address the challenges mentioned earlier (data silos, manual energy monitoring, etc.). You should elaborate on how your solution addresses these pain points.\n3. It would be beneficial to provide more information about the technical implementation details, such as the infrastructure required, scalability considerations, and potential security risks.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. To make your proposal more compelling, consider providing case studies or success stories from existing clients who have implemented similar solutions.\n2. Consider including a roadmap for future development, highlighting features that you plan to add in the near term (e.g., integration with popular energy management systems, advanced analytics capabilities).\n3. Be prepared to address potential challenges and limitations of your solution during the next step.\n\nNow, let's move on to addressing a business problem. Your challenge is:\n\n**Reduce energy costs by 15% within 6 months.**\n\nPlease propose a solution to achieve this goal. How will you measure success, and what are the key performance indicators (KPIs) you would track?",
