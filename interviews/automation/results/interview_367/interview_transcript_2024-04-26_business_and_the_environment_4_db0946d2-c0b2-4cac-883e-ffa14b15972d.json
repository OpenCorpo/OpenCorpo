Our data centers are experiencing equipment failure, and we're unable to recover critical customer data. The issue is identified as a hardware malfunction caused by an unexpected power outage during routine maintenance.\n\nWe have only 2 hours before our RPO for critical business operations expires. How do you propose we respond to this crisis, given the time constraints and limited resources?",

We should consider implementing additional data redundancy measures, such as cloud-based storage or distributed databases, to minimize the risk of data loss.\n2. **Outsourcing recovery functions:** Evaluating the possibility of outsourcing certain recovery functions to external providers could be a viable option for us. This might include partnering with third-party disaster recovery services or utilizing cloud-based solutions for backup and recovery.\n3. **Comprehensive impact analysis:** A thorough impact analysis would help us better understand the potential financial and operational implications of such an outage. This would enable more informed decision-making during the recovery process.\n4. **Communication plan:** You're absolutely right; a comprehensive communication plan should include both internal and external stakeholders. This could include regular updates to employees, customers, and partners regarding the status of our operations and any necessary changes.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful feedback! Let's continue with the next step:\n\n* Step 3: Problem Presentation\n\nPlease provide me with another realistic problem that needs to be addressed within a specific timeframe.",
