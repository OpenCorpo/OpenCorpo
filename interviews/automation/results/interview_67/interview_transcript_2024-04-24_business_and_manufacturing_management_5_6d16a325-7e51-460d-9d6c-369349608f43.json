You've provided a comprehensive framework for risk management, covering assessment, mitigation, communication, and monitoring.\n2. You've highlighted the importance of considering industry-specific and company-specific risks.\n3. Your approach emphasizes prioritizing high-priority risks based on potential impact and likelihood.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The solution seems to focus primarily on reactive measures (mitigating identified risks) rather than proactive steps (anticipating and preventing potential risks).\n2. There's limited discussion of risk governance, which is crucial for ensuring that the risk management framework is integrated into daily operations and decision-making.\n3. Your proposal doesn't explicitly address how to allocate resources for risk mitigation efforts or provide a clear process for escalating identified risks to senior management.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. Consider incorporating proactive measures, such as monitoring industry trends, conducting horizon scanning, and utilizing predictive analytics to identify potential risks early on.\n2. Develop a clear risk governance structure that defines roles and responsibilities, establishes decision-making processes, and ensures accountability.\n3. Provide more details on resource allocation and prioritization strategies for risk mitigation efforts.\n\nNow, I'll propose another problem for you to evaluate:\n\n**Problem:** How can a manufacturing organization effectively implement a total quality management (TQM) system that drives continuous improvement and reduces defects?\n\nPlease respond with your solution!",
