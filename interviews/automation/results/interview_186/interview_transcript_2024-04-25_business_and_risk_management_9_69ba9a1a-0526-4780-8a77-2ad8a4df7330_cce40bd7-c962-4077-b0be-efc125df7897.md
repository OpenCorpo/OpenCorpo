	* Develop detailed data profiling reports to analyze data quality, consistency, and relationships across different datasets.
2. **Data Standardization and Integration**:
	* Implement standardized data formats, naming conventions, and metadata management to facilitate integration and compatibility.
	* Design and develop data integration pipelines using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) approaches.
	* Utilize data virtualization techniques to create a unified view of the data without requiring physical movement of data.
3. **Data Warehousing and Analytics**:
	* Design and implement a dimensional modeling approach for storing historical and current data in a single, unified data warehouse.
	* Develop fact tables optimized for fast retrieval and analysis using data warehousing tools such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics.
	* Implement data visualization tools to provide easy access to insights and enable data-driven decision-making.

**Phased Implementation:**

To ensure a successful implementation, the DCU framework will be rolled out in three phases:

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Data Discovery and Profiling
