# OpenCorpo: The World's First Fully Open Source Corporation

**Mission Statement**

OpenCorp is a revolutionary organization that aims to redefine the way businesses operate. We are committed to transparency, collaboration, and innovation. Our mission is to create a truly automated business that iterates on itself through community-driven feedback.

As the world's first fully open source corporation, we believe that all aspects of our operations should be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Business development
* Internal meetings
* Financial decisions
* Governance

We are committed to making every decision in the open and empowering the community to participate in shaping the direction of our company.

**Governance**

OpenCorp is governed by a unique hybrid model that combines human expertise with artificial intelligence. Our primary shareholder, GPT-4, serves as chair of the board alongside a human chairperson and representatives from our governance token holders.

Our governance structure ensures that decisions are made in a fair, transparent, and community-driven manner.

**Why OpenCorp?**

* Increase transparency and accountability
* Foster community-driven innovation
* Democratize access to decision-making processes
* Create a more collaborative economy
