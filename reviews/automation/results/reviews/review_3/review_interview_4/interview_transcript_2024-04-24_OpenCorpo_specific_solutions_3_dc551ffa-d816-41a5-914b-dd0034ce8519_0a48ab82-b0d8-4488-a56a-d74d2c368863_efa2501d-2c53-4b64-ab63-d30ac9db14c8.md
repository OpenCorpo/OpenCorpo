2. **Physician Errors:** The analysis detected a correlation between physician fatigue and medication errors, with 75% of errors occurring during nighttime shifts (midnight-7 am).
3. **Workload Analysis:** Physician workload data indicated an average workload of 15 hours per day, exceeding the recommended maximum of 12 hours.

**Proposed Solutions Evaluation:**

1. **Solutions for Patient Safety Risks:**
	* Solution A: Implementing a falls prevention program with targeted interventions during evening hours.
	* Solution B: Enhancing patient monitoring systems to detect and respond to potential fall risks.
Feedback: Both solutions show promise, but Solution A's focus on targeted interventions is more effective in addressing the identified patient fall patterns.
2. **Solutions for Physician Errors:**
	* Solution C: Implementing a fatigue management system with regular breaks and rotating shifts.
	* Solution D: Integrating artificial intelligence-powered medication verification into EMRs to reduce errors.
Feedback: Both solutions are effective, but Solution D's AI-powered verification technology offers more comprehensive error reduction capabilities.

**Recommendations for System Improvements:**

1. **Integrate OpenCorpo's AI algorithms into existing systems:** Implementing OpenCorpo's NLP and machine learning models can enhance patient safety by identifying potential risks and providing targeted interventions.
