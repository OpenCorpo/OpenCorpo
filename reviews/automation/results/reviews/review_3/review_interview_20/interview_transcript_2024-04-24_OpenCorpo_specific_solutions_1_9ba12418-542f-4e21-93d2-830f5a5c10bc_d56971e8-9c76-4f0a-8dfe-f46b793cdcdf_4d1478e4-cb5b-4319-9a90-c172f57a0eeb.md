 Your analysis will be evaluated and feedback will be provided. Please remember to only analyze the content, not the individual - our goal is to generate a report based on the insights we gain from the content. Let's get started. You have 30 minutes for this task.

**User**: **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**

* Import the JSON file into a suitable data analysis tool.
* Identify and extract the relevant data points, including customer complaints and support tickets.
* Clean and pre-process the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Step 2: Feature Extraction and Analysis**

* Extract features from the data that are relevant to automated analysis, such as:
    * Severity of issues
    * Customer demographics
    * Support channels used
    * Time of complaints and support tickets
* Perform statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends.

**Step 3: Problem Definition**

* Define the specific problem of identifying and prioritizing relevant issues for automated analysis.
* State the desired output of the chatbot, such as the most impactful issues or the potential frequency of occurrence.

**Step 4: Machine Learning Models**

* Explore and evaluate machine learning models that can be used for problem evaluation, such as:
    * Classification models (e.g., Support Ticket Classification, Complaint Classification)
    * Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means)
    * Topic modeling algorithms

**Step 5: Evaluation and Feedback**

* Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
* Provide feedback on the strengths and limitations of each model.
* Suggest future research directions based on the evaluation results.

**Estimated Time:**

* Data preprocessing: 1 hour
* Feature extraction and analysis: 2 hours
* Problem definition and model selection: 1 hour
* Evaluation and feedback: 1 hour

**Deliverables:**

* A report summarizing the findings of the analysis.
* A set of recommendations for identifying and prioritizing relevant issues for automated analysis.
