	* Root causes: Lack of automation, manual data entry, and limited resources.
2. **Project Management**: Severity: Medium; Impact: Medium; Feasibility of solution: High
	* Current state: Limited visibility into project progress, difficulty in tracking tasks.
	* Root causes: Inadequate project management tools, lack of communication among team members.
3. **Marketing Campaign Management**: Severity: Low; Impact: Low; Feasibility of solution: Medium
	* Current state: Manual tracking of campaign performance, limited insights into customer behavior.
	* Root causes: Limited resources, manual data entry, and inadequate analytics tools.
4. **Financial Management**: Severity: High; Impact: High; Feasibility of solution: High
	* Current state: Difficulty in tracking expenses, limited visibility into financial performance.
	* Root causes: Inadequate accounting software, manual data entry, and limited resources.

**Step 3: Proposed Solution Evaluation**

The proposed Business Process Automation Platform addresses the pain points in all four areas by:

1. Automating manual tasks, reducing errors, and increasing efficiency.
