 Summary: ## Data Privacy & Security Whiteboard:

**Key Concepts:**

* Data privacy: Protecting the personal information of individuals from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
* Data security: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data through appropriate safeguards.
* Data governance: Establishing policies and procedures to ensure the proper handling of data throughout its lifecycle.


**Scalability Issues:**

* Growing volume of data
* Expanding data types
* Changing regulations and compliance requirements
* Difficulty in managing data across multiple systems and teams


**Potential Solutions:**

* **Data Classification & Metadata Management:**
    - Classify data based on sensitivity and risk
    - Define metadata schema for better data understanding
    - Implement data discovery and lineage tracking tools


* **Centralized Data Repository:**
    - Establish a secure and scalable central data repository
    - Integrate data from multiple systems into a single location
    - Improve accessibility and collaboration


* **Automated Data Governance:**
    - Automate data handling processes like masking, encryption, and access controls
    - Implement data loss prevention (DLP) tools to detect and prevent data breaches


* **Data Security & Access Controls:**
    - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and data access controls (DAC)
    - Use encryption at rest and in transit
    - Conduct regular security assessments and audits


**Key Metrics:**

* Data loss incidents
* Data access requests
* Data compliance status
* Data governance efficiency


**Action Plan:**

1. Assess current data privacy and security posture
2. Prioritize scalability needs
3. Develop a roadmap for implementing solutions
4. Allocate resources and set deadlines


## Problem:
