You have 30 minutes.", "Sounds great! I\'m ready to help. Please give me some details about the scalability issues you\'d like to discuss. The more context I have, the better I can assist you in finding a solution.\\n\\nHere are some examples of questions that would be helpful to answer:\\n\\n* Which specific scalability issue(s) are you facing? (e.g., limited resource allocation, data storage constraints, increased customer base, etc.)\\n* What are the current solutions you\'re using to address these issues?\\n* What are your performance and response time goals?\\n* What are your budget and resource limitations?\\n* What is your target audience and marketing goals?\\n\\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with a solution tailored specifically for your situation.", "Thank you for your enthusiasm! Let\'s dive into the scalability issues we\'re facing.\\n\\n**Scalability Issue:** Our customer acquisition process has been experiencing rapid growth, which is putting pressure on our system to handle an increasing volume of user registrations and login requests. We\'ve noticed that during peak hours (e.g., evening rush), response times are slowing down, and we\'re seeing occasional server errors.\\n\\n**Current Solutions:** Currently, we\'re using a combination of Apache HTTP Server and MySQL as our backend technology stack. We have a single web server instance handling incoming requests, and a dedicated database server managing user data. We\'re utilizing load balancing for our production environment, but it\'s not fully optimized for high-traffic scenarios.\\n\\n**Performance and Response Time Goals:** Our goal is to ensure that response times remain under 500 ms during peak hours while maintaining an average latency of less than 200 ms throughout the day. We also aim to achieve a maximum of 2% server error rate.\\n\\n**Budget and Resource Limitations:** We have a limited budget for this project, so we\'re looking for cost-effective solutions that can be implemented within the next 6-8 weeks. Our development team consists of 3-4 full-time engineers, who are already stretched thin handling other priorities. Therefore, any proposed solution should minimize manual labor and optimize automation wherever possible.\\n\\n**Target Audience and Marketing Goals:** We\'re a B2C e-commerce platform focused on providing personalized products for customers with specific interests or hobbies. Our marketing strategy is centered around social media advertising, influencer partnerships, and targeted email campaigns. Our growth rate has been steady over the past year, but we expect it to accelerate in the coming months as our brand recognition increases.\\n\\nNow that you have a better understanding of our situation, I\'d love to hear your suggestions on how to address these scalability issues and improve our customer acquisition process!", \'## Scalability Solutions for Customer Acquisition:\\n\\n**1.
