**User**: Here's a discussion based on the provided interview data:

Interviewer: Thank you for your proposal, it seems like you've identified some key challenges businesses face in managing their cloud computing infrastructure. Can you elaborate more on why you think implementing a Cloud Management Platform (CMP) is the best solution?

Candidate: Yes, of course! I believe that CMPs can help automate many manual tasks, which will lead to significant cost savings and improved security. Additionally, CMPs provide real-time visibility into resource utilization, making it easier to optimize costs and allocate resources more efficiently.

Interviewer: That's a great point. How do you think businesses should approach implementing automation in their cloud infrastructure?

Candidate: I would recommend starting with simple tasks and gradually increasing the level of automation as needed. This will help minimize disruptions and ensure that the IT team is comfortable with the new technology.

Interviewer: What kind of skills or training do you think are necessary for effective CMP utilization?

Candidate: In my opinion, it's essential to provide comprehensive training to the IT team on how to use the CMP effectively. This should include both technical and business skills, as well as continuous monitoring and adjustments to ensure optimal performance.

Interviewer: Can you elaborate more on what kind of potential tools or solutions a CMP like Terraform or CloudHealth could offer?

Candidate: Yes, certainly! For example, Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that allows for automated provisioning and management of cloud resources. CloudHealth is a cloud cost management and optimization platform that provides real-time visibility into resource utilization and recommends ways to optimize costs.

Interviewer: What are your thoughts on the potential challenges or obstacles that businesses might face when implementing a CMP?

Candidate: One challenge could be resistance from IT teams who may be hesitant to adopt new technology. Another challenge could be ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure management tools. Additionally, businesses may need to address any concerns about data security and compliance.
